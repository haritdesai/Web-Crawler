# Web-Crawler
Distributed Web Crawler Node Implementation for Upper Division Information Retrieval Class. 

Implemented in Python within the [Spacetime Framework](https://github.com/Mondego/spacetime) built by the Mondego group at UC Irvine. 

The node application extracts links from webpages within the ics.uci.edu subdomain and then determines whether those links are valid or not by checking for crawler traps or broken links.
